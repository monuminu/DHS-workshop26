# M2 · Tools & Function Calling

> **Goal:** give your agent *hands*. Define function tools, watch the agent loop
> actually iterate, and add a human **approval gate** for sensitive actions.
>
> **You'll use:** the `@tool` decorator, `Agent(tools=[...])`, and approval modes.

---

A model alone can only *talk*. **Tools** let an agent *act* — look up data, call an
API, do math, hit a database. When you attach tools, the agent loop comes alive:

1. The model decides it needs a tool and emits a **tool call**.
2. The framework runs your Python function and feeds the **result** back.
3. The model continues — possibly calling more tools — until it has a final answer."""

## 2. Define a tool

A tool is just a Python function with:

- **type-annotated parameters** (so the model knows what to pass),
- a **docstring** (so the model knows *when* to use it),
- the `@tool` decorator.

`Annotated[..., Field(description=...)]` gives the model a clear description of
each argument.

!!! warning "`approval_mode` in production"
    We use `approval_mode="never_require"` here for brevity. For any tool with
    real side effects (sending email, spending money, deleting data) use

## 🧪 Your turn

1. Add a third tool (e.g. `get_time(timezone)` returning a fixed string) and ask a
   question that needs all three.
2. Make `convert_currency` raise an exception for an unknown currency *instead* of
   returning a message, and observe how the agent reacts. (Agent Framework can
   recover from tool failures — see the upstream
   `function_tool_recover_from_failures.py`.)
3. Switch `transfer_funds` approval to a real prompt with
   `input("approve? ")` and try denying it.
