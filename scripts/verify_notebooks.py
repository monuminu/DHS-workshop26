"""Execute every workshop notebook and check it still teaches what it claims.

Run this before a workshop, and after any dependency bump:

    python scripts/verify_notebooks.py                  # all modules
    python scripts/verify_notebooks.py --only 05 06     # just these
    python scripts/verify_notebooks.py --model gpt-4o   # override the model

Two things it does that a plain ``nbconvert --execute`` loop does not:

1. **Notebooks are never modified.** Each one executes into a throwaway copy in
   memory, so the committed ``.ipynb`` files stay output-free — the site renders
   them with ``execute: false`` and a stray output blob would be committed noise.

2. **It checks outcomes, not just the absence of exceptions.** A notebook can run
   green and still fail to make its point: M6's "vague vs improved agent" demo
   once passed 2/2 both times, so the lesson silently taught nothing (see
   ``bug_report.md`` #3). The EXPECTATIONS table below pins the outputs that
   carry the teaching value.

Exits non-zero if any notebook errors or any expectation goes unmet, so it works
as a pre-flight gate.
