As you build real agents you keep re-assembling the same machinery: the tool
loop, history persistence, compaction, planning, memory, observability. The
**agent harness** is that machinery, packaged.

`create_harness_agent(...)` wires it all up in a single call:

![Agent harness](../../assets/agent-harness.png)

| Component | What it adds | Built by hand in… |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Function invocation** | the automatic tool-calling loop | M2 |
| **History + persistence** | conversation saved after every model call | M3 |
| **Compaction** | automatic context-window management | M3 (concept) |
| **TodoProvider** | the agent plans & tracks its own work items | *new* |
| **AgentModeProvider** | plan vs. execute mode tracking | *new* |
| **MemoryStore** | file-based durable memory across sessions | M3 (concept) |
| **SkillsProvider** | progressive discovery/loading of skills | *new* |
| **OpenTelemetry** | built-in tracing | M7 |
| **Web search** | real-time web search tool | *new* |"""

Every battery can be **disabled or replaced** via keyword args. A few useful ones

| `tools=[...]` | add your own function tools (from M2) |
| `disable_web_search=True` | turn off the built-in web search tool |
| `disable_todo=True` | turn off todo-based planning |
| `disable_memory=True` | turn off durable memory |
| `memory_store=...` | plug in a file-based `MemoryStore` for cross-session memory |

## 5. The interactive research assistant (optional, local)

The upstream sample `02-agents/harness/harness_research.py` turns this into a full
REPL: type a topic, watch it search the web (`🌐`), plan with todos, and stream a
cited report — saving the report to **durable file memory** so it survives
compaction.

Run it locally from the repo root (needs a web-search-capable provider):

```bash
python -m agent_framework  # see the upstream sample for the full loop, or:
# copy harness_research.py from microsoft/agent-framework and run it
```

We don't run the interactive loop in the notebook (it blocks on `input()`), but
the agent you built in section 3 already has all the same machinery."""

## 🧪 Your turn

1. Add a custom tool from M2 (e.g. `get_weather`) via `tools=[...]` and ask a task
   that needs both planning *and* the tool.
2. Set `disable_todo=True` and re-run the Kyoto task — notice the agent no longer
   externalizes a plan. That contrast *is* the value of the TodoProvider.
3. Read the harness table again and map each row to where you built it by hand in
   M2–M3. The harness is your M1–M3 knowledge, assembled.
