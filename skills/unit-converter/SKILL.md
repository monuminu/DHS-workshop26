## Usage

When the user requests a unit conversion:

1. First, read the `references/CONVERSION_TABLES.md` resource to find the correct factor.
2. Then run the `scripts/convert.py` script with `--value <number> --factor <factor>`
   (e.g. `--value 26.2 --factor 1.60934`).
3. Present the converted value clearly, with both units.
